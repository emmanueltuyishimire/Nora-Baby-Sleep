  const faqs = [
    {
      question: "What is the 3-3-3 rule for baby sleep?",
      answer: "The 3-3-3 rule suggests that by 3 months old, babies should be taking 3 naps per day, with 3 hours of awake time between naps, and sleeping for 3-hour stretches at night."
    },
    {
      question: "What do you need for baby sleep?",
      answer: "Essential items include a safe crib with firm mattress, fitted sheet, sleep sack or swaddle, white noise machine, blackout curtains, and a consistent bedtime routine."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the best baby sleep aid?",
      answer: "White noise machines, sleep sacks, and consistent bedtime routines are among the most effective and safe sleep aids. Avoid sleep positioners or loose bedding."
    },
    {
      question: "How to stop baby from waking every hour?",
      answer: "Establish consistent sleep routines, ensure proper feeding during the day, create a sleep-conducive environment, and gradually teach self-soothing skills appropriate for your baby's age."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the fastest sleep training method?",
      answer: "The 'Cry It Out' (Extinction) method can show results in 3-7 days, but gentler methods like 'Ferber' or 'Chair Method' may take 1-2 weeks with less stress for both baby and parents."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the best sleeping method for babies?",
      answer: "The safest method is placing baby on their back in a crib with a firm mattress, no loose bedding, and in the same room as parents for the first 6-12 months (room-sharing without bed-sharing)."
    },
    {
      question: "What age is cosleeping no longer safe?",
      answer: "The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends room-sharing without bed-sharing for at least the first 6 months, ideally for the first year, due to SIDS risk reduction."
    },
    {
      question: "How to tell if baby is too hot at night?",
      answer: "Check the back of baby's neck - if it's sweaty or hot to touch, they're likely too warm. Ideal room temperature is 68-72°F (20-22°C). Dress baby in one more layer than you're comfortable in."
    },
    {
      question: "What helps a baby sleep naturally?",
      answer: "Consistent routines, exposure to natural light during the day, avoiding screens before bedtime, proper feeding schedules, and creating a calm, dark sleep environment."
    },
    {
      question: "What medicine can I give my baby to sleep at night?",
      answer: "Never give sleep medication to babies without explicit direction from a pediatrician. Most sleep issues are behavioral and resolved through routine and sleep training, not medication."
    },
    {
      question: "How to improve baby sleep overnight?",
      answer: "Focus on daytime routines first - ensure adequate feeding, appropriate awake windows, and consistent nap schedules. Night improvements typically follow within 3-7 days of consistent daytime structure."
    },
    {
      question: "How to sleep train a 2 month old?",
      answer: "At 2 months, focus on establishing routines and gentle sleep habits rather than formal sleep training. Put baby down drowsy but awake, maintain consistent bedtime routines, and respond to needs promptly."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the 3am rule?",
      answer: "The '3am rule' suggests that if your baby wakes at 3am, avoid stimulating activities. Keep lights dim, interactions minimal, and focus only on feeding if truly necessary, then return to sleep quickly."
    },
    {
      question: "What to do when baby won't sleep?",
      answer: "Check for hunger, discomfort, or overstimulation. Ensure the sleep environment is conducive to rest. Sometimes a brief period of gentle rocking or walking can help, followed by putting baby down drowsy but awake."
    },
    {
      question: "Should I let my baby cry it out?",
      answer: "This is a personal decision that depends on your parenting philosophy and baby's age. Cry-it-out methods are generally not recommended before 4-6 months. Always consult your pediatrician for guidance."
    },
    {
      question: "How many naps for a 6 month old?",
      answer: "Most 6-month-olds take 2-3 naps per day, totaling 2-3 hours of daytime sleep, with the third nap often being a short catnap in the late afternoon."
    },
    {
      question: "What age is sleep training most successful?",
      answer: "Sleep training is typically most effective between 4-6 months when babies have developed more predictable sleep patterns and can go longer stretches without feeding."
    },
    {
      question: "How to get baby to sleep through the night without feeding?",
      answer: "Ensure adequate daytime feeding, establish consistent bedtime routines, gradually reduce night feedings if baby is developmentally ready (usually 6+ months), and teach self-soothing skills."
    },
    {
      question: "What are common sleep training mistakes?",
      answer: "Starting too early, inconsistency, not addressing underlying issues like hunger or discomfort, expecting immediate results, and not having a clear plan or support system."
    },
    {
      question: "How to stop contact naps?",
      answer: "Gradually transition by starting naps in your arms, then moving to a stationary surface while maintaining contact, then slowly reducing physical contact over several days or weeks."
    },
    {
      question: "What age is SIDS a risk?",
      answer: "SIDS risk is highest between 1-4 months, with 90% of cases occurring before 6 months. Risk significantly decreases after 6 months but safe sleep practices should continue through the first year."
    },
    {
      question: "Do pediatricians recommend co-sleeping?",
      answer: "Pediatricians recommend room-sharing (baby in own crib in parents' room) but not bed-sharing due to increased SIDS and suffocation risks. Always follow safe sleep guidelines."
    },
    {
      question: "How to tell if a baby is overtired?",
      answer: "Signs include fussiness, difficulty settling, rubbing eyes, yawning, arching back, and paradoxically becoming more alert or hyperactive when they should be sleepy."
    },
    {
      question: "What are signs of baby sleep problems?",
      answer: "Frequent night wakings beyond age-appropriate needs, difficulty falling asleep, short naps (under 30-45 minutes consistently), early morning wakings, and excessive fussiness related to sleep."
    },
    {
      question: "How long to hold a baby before putting down?",
      answer: "Hold until baby is in a deep sleep (limp limbs, regular breathing, no eye movement) which typically takes 10-20 minutes after they fall asleep. This reduces the startle reflex that can wake them."
    },
    {
      question: "Should I let my 3 month old take a 3 hour nap?",
      answer: "Long naps during the day can interfere with night sleep. For 3-month-olds, aim to wake baby after 2-2.5 hours of daytime sleep to maintain balanced day/night sleep cycles."
    },
    {
      question: "What is ABC sleep?",
      answer: "ABC stands for Alone, on their Back, in a Crib - the safe sleep guidelines recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics to reduce SIDS risk."
    },
    {
      question: "When to stop swaddling?",
      answer: "Stop swaddling when baby shows signs of rolling over (usually 2-4 months) or when they break out of the swaddle consistently. Transition to a sleep sack with arms free."
    },
    {
      question: "How to teach baby to fall asleep independently?",
      answer: "Put baby down drowsy but awake, establish consistent bedtime routines, respond consistently to night wakings, and gradually reduce sleep associations like rocking or feeding to sleep."
    },
    {
      question: "Is a 20 minute nap ok for babies?",
      answer: "Short naps (20-30 minutes) are normal for newborns but by 4-6 months, most babies should be able to take longer naps (45+ minutes). Consistently short naps may indicate overtiredness or schedule issues."
    },
    {
      question: "What is normal baby sleep?",
      answer: "Newborns sleep 14-17 hours in 24 hours with no day/night distinction. By 6 months, most sleep 12-15 hours with 2-3 naps. Individual variations are normal within these ranges."
    },
    {
      question: "How many hours should a baby sleep?",
      answer: "Newborns (0-3 months): 14-17 hours, Infants (4-11 months): 12-15 hours, Toddlers (1-2 years): 11-14 hours. This includes both nighttime sleep and naps."
    },
    {
      question: "When to stop night feed?",
      answer: "Most babies can go 8-12 hours without feeding by 6 months if they're growing well and getting adequate nutrition during the day. Always consult your pediatrician before eliminating night feeds."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the 2 3 4 rule for baby sleep?",
      answer: "This rule suggests 2 hours awake before first nap, 3 hours before second nap, and 4 hours before bedtime. It's a guideline for 6+ month olds to establish predictable nap schedules."
    },
    {
      question: "At what age can I stop worrying about SIDS?",
      answer: "SIDS risk drops significantly after 6 months and is very rare after 12 months, but safe sleep practices should continue through the first year as a precaution."
    },
    {
      question: "Why put the baby to bed at 7?",
      answer: "An early bedtime (6:30-7:30pm) aligns with babies' natural circadian rhythms, prevents overtiredness, and often results in better quality sleep and fewer night wakings."
